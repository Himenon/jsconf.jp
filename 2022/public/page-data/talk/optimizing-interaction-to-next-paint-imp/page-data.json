In this span of time, users are interacting with your website through a series of interactions such as clicks, taps, and keyboard inputs—and the slower your website is to respond to those interactions, the more likely your users will have a negative user experience with your website.\nAt Google, we've invested significant time in creating new metrics to assess page responsiveness. One of these metrics is First Input Delay (FID), which is a load responsiveness metric that captures the input delay of the first interaction. However, we discovered that we needed a new responsiveness metric that samples more than just the first interaction—and more than simply that interaction's input delay.\nIn order to comprehensively assess overall page responsiveness, we've created the new Interaction to Next Paint (INP) metric. INP samples all page interactions, and goes beyond measuring just the input delay. In this talk, you'll find out all about INP, how it works, why it matters, how you can measure it, and how you can improve it.","descriptionJa":"(Untranslated) Did you know that 90% of time spent on most web pages is after page load?
